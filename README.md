Keylogger Detection Tool

Description:
A straight forward Python tool that checks your machine for malicious processes that might be keyloggers or other kinds of malware that are concealed.
It enables you to detect the threats that may exist and thus, you can terminate the risky processes in a safe manner.

How it works:
This tool goes through all the processes that are currently running and assigns to each a risk score depending on:

Whether the process is running in the background without a window that is visible

Usage of CPU and number of threads

Time duration for which the process has been running

Whether it is a Python script running silently (optional for aggressive scan)

The two scan modes are:

Basic Scan: More or less accurate detection, fewer false positives

Aggressive Scan: Could result in legitimate programs being marked as threats; however, most threats are detected

The processes that have been detected are accompanied by the details and the reasons for which they have been flagged.
After a confirmation popup, you are allowed to end a suspicious process in a safe manner.

Features:

The user interface in dark mode with a neat layout

A list that is scrollable in cases of multiple detections

An End Task button accompanied by a warning popup

Hover tooltips giving brief explanations for each type of scan

PLEASE NOTE: This software may harm your computer if you end certain tasks.
